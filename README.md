# JankyWebServer - Implementation of HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.1 in python

HTTP/1.1 server written in python, I tried to make it as fast and stable as possible

It requires `python-magic` and `psutil` from pip. Python-magic required the `python-magic-bin` package on Windows (may need to intsall old version depending if your Python is up to date) and `libmagic` on Linux
